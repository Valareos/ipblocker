# ipblocker
With help from rico666 and POCC group, this script will allow you to easily manage ip bans for burstcoin pools, to help actively defend against ddos

# Usage
Comes preconfigured with troublesome addresses. Add more by editing the IP.blocked file
run sh block.sh to add custom ips and all aws ips

# IP Removal
If your IP is listed, then you were reported as sending too many nonce submissions to a pool.  If you are a legit miner this may be the result of a poorly configured miner and you should check with your pool operator. If they are satisfied that you are a legit miner and have fixed your issues, they can remove you from their own ban list directly, and contact me to remove them from the list through discord https://discord.gg/UeqDz6p

# Pull Requests
Pool owners can do a pull request to edit the IP.blocked file directly to allow everyone to be protected
